
// Express framework
// Express.js is a fast, flexible and minimalist web framework for Node.js. 
// It’s effectively a tool that simplifies building web applications and APIs 
// using JavaScript on the server side. Express is an open-source that is 
// developed and maintained by the Node.js foundation.

// Express.js offers a robust set of features that enhance your productivity 
// and streamline your web application. It makes it easier to organize your 
// application’s functionality with middleware and routing. 
// It adds helpful utilities to Node HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic 
// HTTP objects


// Key Features of Express:

//01 Middleware and Routing:
// Define clear pathways (routes) within your application to handle incoming 
// HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with ease. Implement reusable 
// functions (middleware) to intercept requests and create responses, adding 
// functionalities like authentication, logging, and data parsing.

//02) Minimalistic Design: 
// Express.js follows a simple and minimalistic design philosophy. 
// This simplicity allows you to quickly set up a server, define routes, 
// and handle HTTP requests efficiently. It’s an excellent choice for 
// building web applications without unnecessary complexity.

//03) Flexibility and Customization: 
// Express.js doesn’t impose a strict application architecture. 
// You can structure your code according to your preferences. 
// Whether you’re building a RESTful API or a full-fledged web app, 
// Express.js adapts to your needs.

//04) Templating Power: 
// Incorporate templating engines like Jade or EJS to generate dynamic HTML 
// content, enhancing user experience.

//05) Static File Serving: 
// Effortlessly serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript from a 
// designated directory within your application.

//06) Node.js Integration: 
// Express.js seamlessly integrates with the core functionalities of 
// Node.js, allowing you to harness the power of asynchronous programming 
// and event-driven architecture.


// Applications of Express:
//Express.js empowers you to construct a wide array of web applications. 
// Here are some captivating examples:

//01) RESTful APIs: 
// Develop robust APIs that adhere to the REST architectural style, enabling 
// communication with other applications and front-end interfaces.

//02) Real-time Applications: 
// Leverage Express.js’s event-driven nature to create real-time applications 
// like chat or collaborative editing tools.

//03) Single-Page Applications (SPAs): 
// Craft SPAs that fetch and update content dynamically on the client-side, 
// offering a seamless user experience.
